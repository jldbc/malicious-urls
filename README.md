# Malicious Urls: Statistical Learning Project
Malicious url classifier build with SVM, random forest, and logistic regression classifiers.

## Data
The data used is a subset of the UCSD malicious url data set, which can be found [here](http://sysnet.ucsd.edu/projects/url/ "Title").

## Does it Work?
Yes, the classifier is very accurate, correctly classifying approximately 99% of the 56,000 observations tested.

## Is it Practical?
No, not at all. This was solely an academic exercise. Collecting the >3 million features observed in this data set in real time in order to turn this into a real-world security system is far outside the scope of this project. 

## How Did you Build it, and How do the Models Work?
